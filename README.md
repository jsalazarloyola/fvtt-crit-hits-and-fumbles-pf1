This does not trigger automatically on a natural 20 or 1 of a d20 roll. Its purely tables that you manually roll on when that event occurs.

These rolltables are found in the 'Critical Rolltables - PF1' Compendium of the Compendium section.

Open the appropriate rolltable for the Crit or fail and the appropriate weapon/damage type, and roll!

It will then display that roll in chat, and will show a clickable link to a Buff with the description of that Crit/Fumble.


For Crits/Fumbles that may have a longer duration, you can drag these Buffs onto any Actor as a reminder that the Crit/Fumble is still in effect.
These buffs are stored in the 'Critical Fumbles - PF1' and 'Critical Hits - PF1' Compendiums.
